# Colorandom

### Abstract:
Colorandom is a web-based application that generates color palettes. Using JavaScript in conjunction with CSS and HTML, we built Colorandom to allow users to generate random color palettes, lock and unlock colors generating more customized palettes, and save their favorite color palettes. Note: saved palettes will not persist across page refreshes.

### Installation Instructions:
- Clone [this repo](https://github.com/Courtney-Lippman/colorandom) to your local computer.
- Open in your text editor.
- Read the README.md.
- In the terminal, run the command open index.html for initial deployment and interaction with app.

### Context:
This project was completed during our fourth week at Turing. It was our second collaborative project and took us five days to complete. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/colorandom-v2.html).

### Learning Goals:
- Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage classes, creating and using an effective data model
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Refine your collaboration skills

### Technology Used
- Atom
- HTML
- CSS
- Chrome Dev Tools
- JavaScript
- Github

### Wins:
- Because we dedicated time to pre-planning, calendaring collaborative work sessions, and creating thoughtful working agreements in our DTR prior to coding, we were highly successful in collaborating as a team of four across three different time zones while still balancing classes, meetings, and other assignments.
- Through this project, we developed a deeper understanding of when and how to use CSS Flexbox.
- We maximized learning and efficiency for all group members by writing code collaboratively, while also allowing time for independent thinking and coding. This allowed us to see multiple approaches as we problem solved as a team.
- We deepened our understanding of the connection between the data model and the DOM and the importance of updating the DOM using the data model.

### Challenges:
- Initially, we struggled with writing code that was long and repetitive, but eventually, we were able to organize our data so that we could use for loops to iterate through it to create clean, DRY code without losing functionality.
- One of our initial challenges in this project was that we were updating our data model and the DOM independently of each other, and the two were not in sync. This led to some issues that forced us to go back and refactor our code.

### Future Features:
- Add local storage so that saved palettes are stored locally and persist upon page refresh
- Modify Palette class to generate colors that follow a specific algorithm that ensures colors in the palette are aesthetically pleasing color combinations after researching how hex codes are generated and color psychology
